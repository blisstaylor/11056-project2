Shroud is an ephemeral spatial drawing that educes what Ben Anderson terms ‘the affective atmosphere’ of life after periods of crisis. 

It responds to the red summer with which the year 2020 began, the subsequent health and economic crisis, and the fissures they have riven in our collective mood.

This year brought the realisation that the slow unravelling of our ecology had gained irreversible momentum. At the same time, the viral outbreak has compelled us to face with sober senses the fragility of our once taken for granted ways of living.

After a year of grief and fear, this artwork asks its audience to take time to pause.

To listen and hold close our ardent longing for the futures we once possessed but that dissolved into smoke,

and to find the fortitude to care for each other through the uncertain future.
