# Reflection

### About the content


This website uses content from an artist featured in contour 556 – Hannah Quinlivan. I have also used materials from her website.

After learning more about 'Shroud' – the artwork the site is about – it became clear that part of the important of the work is to pause and reflect. Keeping this in mind, I designed the site to have lots of space and time for reflection. 

To do this, I have broken up the about text into its sentences, sharing a line or two at a time. There is a fixed image of Shroud in the background at all times, with the lines of text and other images coming over the top as you scroll. There are deliberate breaks in the content to encourage the user to take in the information on the site, as well as to look at the background image.

I have used CSS blur to allow the background image to always have a presence on the site. I've used three colours with the blur to allow the text above to be more legible. The main colour is a muted mid blue which compliments the tones in the daytime images. I've used orange where the images are warm and orange lights up the artwork. This section of the site also is discussing the 2019/20 bushfires, making it an appropriate colour. Purple is used at the end of the site to match the nighttime image the site finishes on.


### About the process

Using the static site generator at first was confusing. Not going to lie! But once I got the hang of it and understood how the different files related to each other it made much more sense. 

For this specific site it would probably make more sense to just code it normally as it is a one page site and there are a lot of images and broken up text. However, I can definitely see how this format would be useful on a larger site.
